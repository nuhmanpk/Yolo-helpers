    "# Splitting Data into Train and Validation Sets\n",
    "* This code defines a Python function called split_data that takes in a folder_path parameter, which represents the path to the folder containing the image files that need to be split into train and validation sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Within the function, the os and random modules are imported to allow for directory and file handling, as well as randomizing the order of the image files.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The os.listdir method is used to retrieve a list of all the files in the folder_path directory that end with the .jpg file extension. These file names are then concatenated with the folder_path to form absolute file paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The random.shuffle method is called on the list of image file paths to randomly shuffle the order of the files.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The split_index variable is set to 80% of the total number of image files using int(0.8 * len(image_files)).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The train_files variable is assigned to a slice of the shuffled image file list from the beginning to the index of split_index, representing the 80% of files used for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The valid_files variable is assigned to a slice of the shuffled image file list from the index of split_index to the end, representing the 20% of files used for validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Two text files are then created and written to, using the open method in write mode and the with statement to ensure the files are properly closed after writing. The train.txt file contains the file paths for the training images, while the val.txt file contains the file paths for the validation images.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finally, the function prints a message that indicates the total number of images in the directory, as well as the number of images allocated for training and validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*To use this function, simply call it and pass in the path to your image files directory, for example: `split_data('path/to/your/folder')`."
